fs
==

node based file server for flat files, ln -s from the /public folder

once node is installed simply navigate to the folder and run 'node index.js'

This will start a server running at localhost:8080 ,

e.g.

git clone git@github.com:atleastimtrying/fs.git

cd fs

ln -s ~/projects/your_project/ public/project

node index.js

then in chrome visit 'http://localhost:8080/project' and your html files should be there.
